Delegate a workspace to a remote Executor for collaborative task execution.

## When to use

Use delegation when:
- Task requires a different environment or specialized toolset
- You want to parallelize work across multiple agents
- The remote agent has capabilities you lack (e.g., browser, GPU, specific SDKs)

Do NOT use when:
- Task is trivial and can be done locally
- You need real-time back-and-forth interaction during execution

## Background mode

**Prefer background=true by default.** This lets you launch multiple delegations in parallel and continue working.

Use background=false only when you cannot proceed without the result.

## Writing effective prompts

Structure your prompt with:
- **What to do**: Clear, specific goal
- **Expected outcome**: What success looks like
- **Context**: Relevant file paths, patterns, constraints
- **What NOT to do**: Scope boundaries to prevent over-engineering

## Examples

### Parallel tasks
```
delegate(background: true, description: "Fix linting errors", prompt: "...", workspace_dir: "/project", peer_url: "...")
delegate(background: true, description: "Add unit tests", prompt: "...", workspace_dir: "/project", peer_url: "...")
```

### Synchronous (when result needed immediately)
```
delegate(background: false, description: "Generate config", prompt: "Create tsconfig.json for...", workspace_dir: "/project", peer_url: "...")
```

### Read-only analysis
```
delegate(description: "Code review", prompt: "Review the code for security issues...", workspace_dir: "/project", peer_url: "...", access_mode: "ro")
```
